# TODO Data so I don't forget everything
1) Monetary economy
- Money is gained by selling items to the admin shop and bartering with other players
    - Because money is tied to an admin shop, all money is backed by ingame items
- Commands will be /md, which displays current money, and /md pay <PLAYER> <AMOUNT> which gives AMOUNT money to the target
- Death will have the player drop 25% of their current money

2) Admin shop, accessed by /shop
- Items are provided with an initial value as well as an inflation modifier
    - Upon enough items being sold to the shop, the item will be given an inflation stack, and decreased in value based on the inflation modifier
    - Each stack is removed after one day 
- A certain amount of items can be sold to a shop in a given period, after which the item is locked for a time # TODO Decide time
- Care must be taken to ensure no infinite money exploits can occur!

3) Hit system
- Server designates a target and provides their location within 500 blocks. 

4) Reworked death system
- Server setting with VANILLA, VANILLA_COORDS, SAFE, SAFE_COORDS, KEEPINVENTORY, KEEPINVENTORY_COORDS
    - Vanilla: no difference from vanilla
    - Vanilla coords: players are provided with coordinates upon death. 
    - Safe: items are placed inside a chest upon death. If voided, KEEPINVENTORY is used.
    - Safe coords: items are placed inside a chest upon death. If voided, KEEPINVENTORY_COORDS is used. Players are provided with coords.
    - Keepinventory: players do not drop anything upon death.
    - Keepinventory coords: players do not drop anything upon death. Players are provided with coords.
- With "coords" variants, players can access their previous death locations via a death history GUI

# Uncertain ideas:
- Player customization unlocked via currency? Particles for arrows and players?
